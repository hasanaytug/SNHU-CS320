##How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The best way to be sure that the program functions as intended is to test frequently. Specifically, every little piece of the code needs to be tested via unit tests. After unit testing, these little components need to be integrated, and integration testing should be performed on them. Finally, after integration testing, the system needs to be tested as a whole, which is called system testing.
##How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
One of the most important stages of software development is the requirements gathering and analysis phase. The software requirements need to be carefully detected in this phase. If the software needs are beyond the budget or the current technology, this needs to be addressed in this phase. You must also ensure that everyone is on the same page about every single requirement through client surveys and meetings. After developing the software, the client verifies if the requirements have been met via acceptance testing.
##How do I approach designing software?
After collecting the requirements from the client, every item needs to be laid out in the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document. SRS documents act as a roadmap or a blueprint to design the software within the scope of the client's requirements.
